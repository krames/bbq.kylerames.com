I would have never thought to pair dates with blue cheese, but my wife and I discovered these on a trip to the now defunct [Bin 555](http://www.yelp.com/biz/bin-555-san-antonio). I had forgot about them until one day flipping through my copy of [Weber's Time to Grill](http://www.amazon.com/Webers-Time-Grill-Grilling/dp/0376020601/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1426355301&sr=8-1), I rediscovered them.

This is a simple *(I say that, but my wife always prepares them)*, but impressive appetizer.

###### Glaze

1 cup balsamic vinegar
1/2 cup granulated sugar


###### Dates

3 ounces soft blue cheese
1/2 cup finely chopped pecans
24 medjool dates

Here is how to make them:

1. In small sauce pan combine the vinegar and sugar. Bring to simmer and cook until mixture coats the back of a spoon, about 10 minutes, stiring occationally. Set aside.

2. In a small bowl mash the blue cheese and pecans together with a fork. Make a slice the length of each date and pull out the pit. Stuff each date with about 1 teaspoon of the cheese mixutre, pressing it closed as much as possible.

3. Place dates on grill pan and cook over direct medium heat until heated through. This usually take a couple of minutes.

4. Arrange on platter and let them cool for 10 minutes. Serve them with the glaze.

Here is a shot of them prepped and ready for the grill:

And here is what is left of them after I was able to drag myself away from them long enough get my camera:
