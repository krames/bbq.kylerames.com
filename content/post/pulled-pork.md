For my daughter's second birthday we decided to do a barbeque at home. I was trying to decided what to cook and after some debate I opted for pulled pork because I hadn't done it for a while. More specifically, I haven't made it since my daughter's first birthday. (I smell the start of a tradition!)

Flash forward to Costco. I always like to pay their meat counter a visit ever time I stop in. I have always been amazed by the size of their butts. They are **HUGE**. I was about ready to pass on them, that is until I  checked the price. 12.85 lb for $24.29. **SOLD!** Upon closer inspection I noticed that they were boneless. I thought it was odd, but for that price I thought it was worth a try.

I took them home and opened them up to find two nicely marbled butts. I rinsed them off and did some miscellaneous trimming.

Here are the butts after a heathy dose of [The Squeal Rub](http://www.thekansascitybbqstore.com/products/cowtown-the-squeal-hog-rub).(It is my favorite pork rub. I have always found this rub hard to find and was recently delighted to find it at my local [World Market](http://www.worldmarket.com/product/cowtown-squeal-hog-rub.do) as well as my local Academy.)

After rubbing them down, I injected them with Chris Lilly's infamous pork injection. You can find this receipe in his excellent [Big Bob Gibson's BBQ Book](http://www.amazon.com/Big-Bob-Gibsons-BBQ-Book/dp/0307408116/ref=tmm_pap_swatch_0?_encoding=UTF8&sr=&qid=). 

I have reprinted it for your convenience:

* 3/4 cup apple juice
* 1/2 cup water
* 1/2 cup sugar
* 1/4 cup salt
* 2 tablespoons Worcestershire

I prepped the butts the day before and started my egg at 6:30am the following morning. The butt's went on at 225°F at 7pm.

The cook went down like this:

<table>
<tr><th>Time</th><th>Egg Temp</th><th>Larger Butt Temp</th></tr>
<tr><td>8am</td><td>275°F</td></td><td>75°F</td></tr>
<tr><td>9:15am</td><td>230°F</td><td>129°F</td></tr>
<tr><td>10:13am</td><td>255°F</td><td>147°F</td></tr>
<tr><td>11:43am</td><td>261°F</td><td>163°F</td></tr>
</table>

I wrapped the butts at 11:54am. The smaller butt was at 168°F and the larger butt was at 163°F. At 1:17pm, the egg was at 252°F and the larger butt was at 181°F.

At 2:25pm the smaller butt had reached 206°F so I pulled it. The larger on reached 199°F at 2:41, but was really soft so I pulled it. One a side note, it is a little interesting to judge the doneness of a butt without a bone. In the end, I just pulled them when my thermapen went into them like a hot knife through warm butter.

These sat in wrapped up in an extra layer of aluminum foil and paper towels in a turned off oven for a couple hours before the party started.

When the time came, my wife ripped them up using [bear paws](http://www.amazon.com/Bear-Paw-Products-Inc-11001/dp/B003IWI66W/ref=sr_1_2?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1435781009&sr=8-2&keywords=bearpaws+bbq). We also poured in some of the excess juices from the foil (only some of them...there was a lot!)

It was excellent! Here are the pictures of the final product.

We served it on buns along with the choice of a [Columbia Gold Barbecue Sauce](http://amazingribs.com/recipes/BBQ_sauces/south_carolina_mustard_BBQ_sauce.html) and [East Carolina Kiss & Vinegar Barbecue Sauce & Mop](http://amazingribs.com/recipes/BBQ_sauces/east_carolina_BBQ_sauce.html). 

By the way, if you have not had a mustard BBQ sauce I would **HIGHLY** recommend the Columbia Gold Barbecue Sauce!!! I would recommend making both recipes the day before so the flavors can meld in the fridge over night.
