I am a big fan of all of Weber cookbooks. Last year, they gave us [New American Barbecue](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01CQ8LF9I/ref=dp-kindle-redirect?_encoding=UTF8&btkr=1) that visits a lot of different BBQ traditions across the USA. In flipping through this book, I found my favorite new thing -- the Spiedie! 

These are sandwiches (hoagies) that come all the way from Binghamton, NY and can be found all over Central New York. They consist of cubes of chicken, pork, or beef that have been marinated and cooked quickly over a pit. If you are interested in learning more check out [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spiedie) OR an even better idea is to make them!

I tweaked the ingredients a bit. If you want the exact recipe, definitely pick up the book.

Here are the ingredients  I use:

```
1 cup extra-virgin olive oil
1/4 cup red wine vinegar
1/4 cup fresh lemon juice
1/4 cup basil
1.5 tbsp of dried dill
2 tsp minced garlic
2 tsp kosher salt
1.5 tsp fennel seed
1/2 fresh ground pepper


1.5 lb pork loin cut into 1.5-inch cubes
6 Italian/French Rolls
```

And here is how I made them:

Mix the marinade ingredients together and reserve 1/4 of a cup to drizzle on the sandwiches. Pour the marinade into a ziplock bag containing the cubed pork. Allow pork to marinate in the refrigerator for two hours.

Thread the pork onto skewers. Preheat your-your grill medium heat (400°F) and then throw in one handful of hickory chips. The pork should be cooked over direct heat turning occasionally until it reaches 145°F.

Slice the rolls and then place a skewer in the middle of the bread. Then squeeze the bread while pulling out the skewer. Lastly, drizzle some of the reserved marinade on top. Enjoy!

Oh! And just a tip, if you are in San Antonio, try using a baguette from the [BreadBox](http://thebreadboxsa.com/our-menu/). It was just the right size and nice and fresh to boot.

I highly recommend trying these!!!
