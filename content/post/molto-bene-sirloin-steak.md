When I started my blog at the beginning of the year my goal was to get out at least two posts a month. As it turns out my last post was from two months ago!! What can I say, September was a very busy month for me. We celebrated Jen's birthday and helped my mother-in-law move down to SA. If you can believe it this post has been in the making since July 31st. So without further ado, I give you *Molto Bene Sirloin Steak*.

I have found myself getting in a rut lately. We have been grilling nothing but chicken breasts and pork tenderloins. I wanted to do something a bit different, but I wasn't looking to do anything terribly extravagant. I set my focus on finding a recipe for cheaper cut of beef. After digging through my grill books and perusing through the recipes on [Weber.com](http://www.weber.com/recipes) I found a recipe for a [Molto Bene Sirloin Steak](http://www.weber.com/recipes/beef/molto-bene-sirloin-steak).


You can find it on [weber.com](http://www.weber.com/recipes/beef/molto-bene-sirloin-steak), but I have reprinted it for your convenience: 

###### Ingredients
6 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil
3 tablespoons red wine vinegar
1 tablespoon balsamic vinegar
1 teaspoon finely chopped fresh rosemary leaves
1 teaspoon minced garlic
1 teaspoon kosher salt
Freshly ground black pepper

1 top sirloin steak, 1½ to 2 pounds and about 1¼ inches

###### Directions

1. Mix marinade ingredients.
2. Place steak and marinade into ziplock bag for 6-8 hours.
3. Prior to grilling allow steak to stand at room temperature for 15-30 minutes.
3. Grill on direct heat for 10-12 minutes for medium rare.
4. Rest steak for 3-5 minutes before serving.

This is the marinaded steak resting at room temperature:

I threw 1.5 handfuls of oak chips into a 550°F egg. The steak reached 135°F after 8 minutes.

Here is the resting steak:

To accompany the steak, We had red peppers marinated in olive oil, oregano, salt, pepper and red vinegar (So good!). Broccoli coated in Dizzy Pig's [Shaking the Tree Rub](http://www.amazon.com/Dizzy-Pig-Shakin-Tree-Spice/dp/B005PIM9ME/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1443384316&sr=8-1&keywords=shaking+the+tree+rub). And last but not least, rosemary potatoes.
