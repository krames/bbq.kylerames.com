The latest Christmas tradition in the Rames household is a Christmas Eve brisket. To make things extra merry this year, my Costco has started to stock prime briskets!

###### Brisket Selection

When picking out a brisket I always shoot for something around 12 lb with a consistent thickness. I have also been known to grab one end and shake it to find the most flexible brisket. 

>*One a side note*, I have also heard an old pitmaster's trick to select a left handed brisket with the thought that most cows are right footed and the right sided always gets more use and thus tougher. I would also add this to my list of criteria if I could figure out what makes a brisket left handed!

Most of the briskets on hand seemed to be too big or too small. I was eyeing one that was around 11 lb, but in the end I just had a better feeling about a smaller about this 10.55 one.

###### Brisket Prep

I prepped the brisket the day before Christmas Eve.

After rinsing the brisket I proceeded to trim a ton of fat off of it leaving an 1/4 - 1/8 inch fat cap. It was almost to the point where I worried it if was enough food! Afterwards, I brushed it with olive oil and then rubbed it down with some [hoochie mama rub](http://www.amazon.com/Suckle-Busters-Hoochie-Spicy-Ounce/dp/B00DUPVTLG/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1421532070&sr=8-1). With moisture always being a concern I injected it with some low sodium beef broth using my [Butterball injector](http://www.amazon.com/dp/B002SG6HRE/ref=sr_ph?ie=UTF8&qid=1421532211). (I have tried other brands and this one is my favorite).

This is what it looked like after prep:

###### The Cook

I always used to cook my briskets on my Big Green Egg at 225°F, but I seem to have had better luck kicking it up to 250°F. My wood of choice has always been Mesquite for brisket. (Although, I would love to try post oak if I could find it in chunks).

The cook went down like this:

* Brisket on at **8am** 
* Brisket hit 160°F at **10am**. I wrapped it in aluminum foil along with some extra beef broth.
* Brisket hit 165°F at **11am**
* Brisket hit 190°F at **12pm**
* Brisket hit 197°F at **12:40pm**. My thermapen went in and out like warm butter so I pulled it.

After I pulled it I added an another layer of foil. I then wrapped it up in a couple towels and placed it in an oven **upside down** so that the meat could reabsorb some of the lost juices (The oven was off). I checked the temperature every hour. At about the 3 hour mark it was dangerously close to 140°F so I removed the towels and turned the oven to warm. About an hour before dinner, my wife needed the oven so I moved it onto Weber Genesis. I turned  one burner on low and continued to watch the temperature.

At about 30 minutes prior to serving I removed it from the aluminum foil  reserving the juices. I seared it on my genesis for 5 minutes a side. I poured some of the reserved juices on it and let it rest an additional 30 minutes out in the open.

I think this might be my best brisket yet.

###### Final Thoughts

I have always stuggled to get my timing down. Looking at the past couple cooks I feel the right amout time for my technique is about 30 minutes per pound with 2 hours of resting in the oven. After which, I should sear it and pull it out in the air for 30 minutesish.

Other ideas for experimentation: 

* Use a classic Texas salt and pepper rub.
* Forgo the aluminum foil during the cooking process. (I am waiting for a pit controller before doing this as I think it would necessitate an over night cook)
