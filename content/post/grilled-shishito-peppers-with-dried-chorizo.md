HEB has started doing [Backyard kitchen](http://www.ksat.com/content/pns/ksat/marketplace/heb-backyard-kitchen.html) segment/commercial every morning on KSAT. The always do some tasty looking segments. A couple weeks ago they did [Grilled Shishito Peppers with Dried Chorizo](http://www.ksat.com/content/pns/ksat/marketplace/heb-backyard-kitchen/video-recipes/heb-grilled-shishito-peppers-with-dried-chorizo.html). It looked so good and easy to I had to try it.

You just alternate a dried Spanish style chorizo sausage with Brun-Uusto grilling cheese (which I have always wanted to try) and Shishito peppers.

Here are the ingredients:

And the skewered results waiting for the grill:

These were coated in olive oil and then grilled 2-3 minutes per side.

Here is the final product:

These were amazing, but a word of caution about 1 in 10 shishito peppers can be **SUPER** hot.
