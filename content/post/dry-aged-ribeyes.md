For our fifth wedding anniversary, Jen and I headed to Seattle, WA. While walking around Pike's Place market we bumped into local chef Tom Douglas's [Rub With Love Shack](http://www.rubwithloveshack.com/). I couldn't leave without walking away with 3 of his [rubs](http://store.tomdouglas.com/rubs-c2.aspx).

I was most excited about the [Exotic Mushroom Rub](http://www.amazon.com/Rub-Love-Exotic-Mushroom-Douglas/dp/B000VBVZRK) which contains actual porcini mushrooms. According to his website he uses it to finish off steaks at his restaurant.

About a week after our trip Jen headed to the central market and came back with some very nice looking dry aged prime ribeyes weigh in at 1.1 lb. I rubbed them down with a little olive oil and a healthy dose of rub.

I did my usual reverse sear on them and started them off on my egg @ 250°F with two fist fulls of oak chips.

Here is the timeline:

<table>
<tr><th>Time</th><th>Steak 1</th><th>Steak 2</th><th>Egg</th></tr>
<tr><td>5:36PM</td><td></td><td></td><td>250°F</td></tr>
<tr><td>5:43PM</td><td>71°F</td><td>85°F</td><td></td></tr>
<tr><td>5:47PM</td><td>86°F</td><td>94°F</td><td>300°F</td></tr>
<tr><td>5:54PM</td><td>120°F <i>Pulled</i></td><td>105°F</td><td></td></tr>
<tr><td>5:59PM</td><td></td><td>112°F <i>Pulled</i></td><td></td></tr>
</table>

I then brought the egg up to searing temperatures and cooked these for 1 minute per side. We then topped these off with a pat of butter and a little more rub.

These were probably the **BEST** steaks I have ever had in my life. I think I am going to have to set my Weber Chicago Steak Seasoning aside and use the Exotic Mushroom Rub from now on!!
