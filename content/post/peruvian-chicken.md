We made this recipe

http://www.seriouseats.com/recipes/2012/08/peruvian-style-grilled-chicken-with-green-sauce-recipe.html

We got a 3.5 lb chicken from central market.

I did raised direct and flipped it occasionally. The skin was good, but could be crispier.  I think I could have probably put it skin down for 10 minutes and then cook the rest right side up.

Jen made the sauce and omitted the mayonnaise. It was a little thin. There was a ton of it, we could probably cut the recipe in half. 

It was really tasty. We should do this again.
