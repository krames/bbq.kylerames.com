Jen and I were in the mood for some fish, so I checked the latest [weekly specials](http://groomerseafood.com/weekly-specials/) at Groomers and found a special on East Coast Swordfish. (If you like fish and live in San Antonio you have to go to Groomers!)

I dug through all of my cookbooks and found a excellent recipe in [Planet Barbecue](http://www.amazon.com/Planet-Barbecue-Steven-Raichlen/dp/0761148019/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1430600757&sr=8-1&keywords=planet+barbeque) for grilled swordfish with garlic caper butter. (It's what Steven Raichlen makes when he is home in Martha's Vineyard during swordfish season)

###### Ingredients

Swordfish steaks (obviously)
Coarse salt
Freshly ground pepper (you have a pepper mill, right?)
1 lemon

1/2 stick unsalted butter
3 cloves garlic
3 tablespoons drained capers

Oak chips

###### Directions
1. Rinse and blot fish dry. Apply salt, pepper, olive oil. Squeeze half a lemon on both sides of the fish. Allow to marinade in fridge for 15 minutes.

2. Grill fish on high with a small handful of oak chips for 3-4 minutes per side.

3. To make sauce melt butter in saucepan. Add garlic and capers and cook over high heat until garlic begins to brown and capers are crisp, about 2 minutes. Pour over fish and serve immediately with lemon wedges.

Here is what the fish looked like after it came off the grill:

And here is the final product:

We served these with bread and some asparagus:

These were delicious change of pace, but Jen still prefers our lemon basil marinade.
