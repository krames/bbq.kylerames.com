In the past I always stored my extra wood chips in my gas grill. It's a very convenient location, but I have also ended up throwing away bags of rotten chips that have succumb to the elements.

After searching off and on for a solution, I finally found a cheap one! Cereal containers from Costco. As an added bonus they are so much easier to find.
