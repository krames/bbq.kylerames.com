I have been eyeing the creamy mustard sauce recipe from my [Weber's Time to Grill](http://www.amazon.com/Webers-Time-Grill-Grilling/dp/0376020601/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1426355301&sr=8-1) for quite some time. When I finally decided to make [pork chops](http://bbq.kylerames.com/2015/03/14/pork-chops-with-creamy-mustard-sauce/) for my mother in law, I thought it was the perfect time to try it out. And it did not disappoint!

I didn't get a chance for a picture, so you will just have to settle for the recipe.

1 tablespoon unsalted butter
2 tablespoons minced shallot
2 tablespoons bourbon
1/2 cup low-sodium beef broth
3/4 cup heavy whipping cream
3 tablespooks whole-grain mustard
Kosher salt


In a medium skillet over medium heat, melt the butter. Add the shallot and cook until softened 1-2 minutes, stiring often. Add the bourbon and cook until reduced to a glaze, about 30 seconds. Add broth and bring to boil over high heat. Cook until broth reduced by half, 2-3 minutes. Add the cream and bring to a simmer. Whisk in mustard and simmer until the sauce is reduced to 3/4 of a cup and is thick enough to coat the back of a spoon. 3-5 minutes. Season with salt.

*Note: This recipe originally called for cognac or brandy. We opted for bourbon because it was all we had.*
