To accompany my [Christmas Eve Brisket](http://bbq.kylerames.com/christmas-brisket/) I wanted to do a special appetizer. I knew just the right one, Cedar-Planked Brie from [Weber's Smoke](http://www.amazon.com/Webers-Smoke-Guide-Cooking-Everyone/dp/0376020679/ref=sr_1_cc_1?s=aps&ie=UTF8&qid=1421613193&sr=1-1-catcorr). It's so simple and the results have always been excellent. 

All you have to do is soak a cedar plank in water for about an hour. You then place the plank on direct medium heat until the underside starts to smoke (about 5 - 10 minutes). You then flip the plank and place a brie wheel directly on top. (I got mine from Costco). Continue to cook until the cheese softens (about 10 minutes.)

The book has a recipe for a cherry chutney, but I opted to use [Robert Rothchild Tart Cherry Preserves with Pomegranate](http://www.robertrothschild.com/product/product-details.aspx?prodID=880&name=Tart+Cherry+Preserves+with+Pomegranate) which I found at [Central Market](http://www.centralmarket.com/Home).

The recipe suggests topping with almonds which I decided to ommit.
