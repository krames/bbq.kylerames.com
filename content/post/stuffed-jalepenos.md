To go along with my [rub some butt ribs](/2015/01/25/baby-back-ribs/), I decided to do some stuffed jalapeños. I usually stuff them with a mix boursin and sharp cheddar cheese. I didn't happen to have any boursin on hand so I thought I would give cream cheese a try.

Most of stuffed jalapeños I have found cut the jalapeños in half. But, since I have a fancy Steven Raichlen [jalapeño rack and corer](http://www.amazon.com/Steven-Raichlen-Best-Barbecue-Stainless/dp/B0028Y4FHK/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1422217228&sr=8-1), I usually opt to core them and stuff them whole. (I also omit the bacon. One less thing.)

Here are what the jalapeños looked like after coring them:

And here is the cream cheese and sharp cheddar mixture.

I have found using a spoon along with a small butter knife help to poke the mixture down.  I then topped them with a generous amount of [Bad Byron's Butt Rub](http://www.amazon.com/Bad-Byrons-Barbecue-Seasoning-Ounce/dp/B000QV4U4U/ref=sr_1_3?ie=UTF8&qid=1422216883&sr=8-3) to arrive here:

These went on along side my ribs. After about **25 minutes** they had the right amount of give to them so I pulled them.

They were delicious, but the batch of jalapeños were a little too spicy for me.

In the future I would like to try wrapping a couple of them up with bacon. I would also like to try some alternative stuffing.
