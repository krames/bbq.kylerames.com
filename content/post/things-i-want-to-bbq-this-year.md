Rather than make New Year's resolutions (which are meant to be broken), I like to look at it as an opportunity to do some goal setting. 

I am hoping to try to squeeze in the following cooks:

* Beef Ribs -- Plate ribs and/or short ribs
* Beef Tenderloin
* Oysters -- ala [Acme Oyster House](https://louisiana.kitchenandculture.com/recipes/acme-chargrilled-oysters)
* St Louis Style Ribs --I want to give them another shot.
* Paella --Finally use the paella pan my mother in law gifted me.
* Turkey Pastrami  --Sounds like some great lunch meat!
* Cherry Glazed Ribs  --ala [Two Bros](http://www.twobrosbbqmarket.com/)
* Grilled Sirlon --ala [Two Bros](http://www.twobrosbbqmarket.com/)
