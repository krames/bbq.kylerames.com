I usually make grilled jalapenos along with brisket, so when I set out to do my [latest brisket](http://bbq.kylerames.com/2016/10/22/september-brisket/) I went to reach for my favorite [recipe](http://bbq.kylerames.com/2015/01/25/stuffed-jalepenos/). Sometime between that and buying a brisket, I discovered that the latest [Weber blog post](http://www.weber.com/weber-nation/blog/a-spicy-game-day-alternative) was for jalapeno poppers. It sounded good to me so I thought I would give it a shot.

I didn't follow the recipe exactly; I decided to skip the bacon and opted for a grill pan rather than a skewer.


Here is what you will need:
```
Ingredients:
10           large jalapeno peppers (red or green) At least 1 inch wide
2              Smoked polish sausages
1              Block smoked cheddar (do not buy aged cheddar, it will get dry and chalky when heated up)

```

I started off my cutting the cheese and sausages (I used the kielbasa natural garlic sausages) into small matchstick sized pieces. After that was done, I slit the peppers lengthwise and then dug out the stems and seeds with my jalapeno corer. The last part was to simply jam as much cheese and sausage I could into each pepper.

I then cooked these indirect at 400Â°F on my egg with a little hickory smoke. In about 20 minutes they were done. They were really excellent! I think the sausage definitely adds a little something, but I thought a little ranch dip would set them over the top.) As luck would have it, my favorite San Antonio chef was on CBS handing out his [BBQ recipes](http://www.cbsnews.com/news/the-dish-chef-jason-dady/)! I look forward to trying this again with a little dip!
