```
Cherry glazed baby back ribs
Serves 8 

Ingredients 

4 lb baby back ribs
2 oz paprika
1 oz smoked paprika
1 oz ground cumin
1 oz ground fennel seed
2 oz brown sugar
1 oz ground coriander
1 oz cayenne pepper
1 oz kosher salt
8 oz cherry syrup (Italian soda style)

Directions 

Start a fire in your fire pit. Smoke the ribs for four hours at 225 degrees or until tender enough to pull apart.
For the ribs - peel the back membrane off and discard. Trim any excess fat.
For the rub, mix all the dry ingredients together. Season the ribs liberally with the dry rub and smoke the ribs for three hours.
After three hours, start glazing the ribs with the cherry syrup. You should end up with a shiny, slightly sticky glaze. Glaze the ribs one last time prior to service.
