I have been shooting for at least two posts a month, but time ran away from me in February. Luckly, that didn't stop me from BBQing so I have a lot of posts coming!!

Jen's mother paid us a visit at the end of January to see her granddaughter. I wanted to fix her something special, but I didn't have the time to do something low and slow. My first thought was a nice juicy steak, but I wanted to do something a little different. --Then it hit me, how about some bone in pork chops!

With that in mind, Jen came back from the store with some B-E-A-utiful tomahawk berkshire pork chops from [Central Market](http://www.centralmarket.com/Home).

I rubbed these down with [Weber Chicago Steak Seasoning](http://www.amazon.com/Weber-Chicago-Steak-Seasoning-171/dp/B007NLKUF4/ref=sr_1_6?ie=UTF8&qid=1426354355&sr=8-6). And because the chops looked so good, here is one more pic!

These rested on the counter for 30 minutes while my egg came up to 300°F. I cooked the pork using the reverse sear method along with 1 1/2 handfulls of hickory wood chips.

Around 6:45, I checked the temps. A couple of them were at 96°F and one was at 76°F so I shuffled them around. The grill temp crept up to 350°F at 7pm. I checked the chops and found found that two  were at 110°F and two were at 100°F. I ended up pulling them around 7:04pm. Some were at my target temp of 125°F and a couple were right at 140°F.

I then opened up my egg and seared them for 1-2 minutes a side (a little less for the 140°F chop). I opted to sear them with the top open and I ended up with some rather large flames coming out of the grill. (Might have been due to a mix of old and new lump).

Here is the final shot:

These chops were so amazing, so much so that I thought about them for days!!! I think it had a lot to do with the quality of the pork. The [creamy mustard sauce](http://bbq.kylerames.com/2015/03/14/creamy-mustard-sauce/) that we used to finish them off didn't hurt either!
