After my first successful brisket, my wife casually mentioned to me that I should really write down what I did. --And of course I did. 

Unfortunately when I reached for my notes during my next cook I found them lacking and so was my brisket. Despite the lack of success, I wrote down what I did and what I wanted to change for next time. I have continuted this practice and overtime I have found my results to be more consistent. I attribute a lot of that to my notes.

Over the past year I have found people asking me for BBQ advice and I figure now is a good time to turn my notes into a blog that can be used by everyone.

I hope you get as much out of it as I do!
