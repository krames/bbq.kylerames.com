My two year daughter's favorite hobby is grocery shopping. After a trip to Trader Joe's with her mother she came back with some [BBQ Rub and Seasoning with Coffee and Garlic](http://www.traderjoes.com/digin/post/bbq-seasoning-with-coffee-garlic). How thoughtful!

I thought the best way to try this out was with some pork chops, so I sent my daughter (and my wife) out to [Central Market](http://www.centralmarket.com/Home). They came back with some beautiful looking berkshire porterhouse pork chops. I had read the longer this rub was on the pork the better so I rubbed them down at lunch in anticipation of a tasty dinner.

I cooked these indirect at 250°F until they hit a target temperature of 110°F. I then pulled and tented them while I waited for my egg to reach searing temperatures. I seared them for a little over 1 minute per side. 

Here are the final results:

All and all I thought the rub (and the pork) were pretty good. It is definitely worth trying, but I don't know if it will earn a permanent spot in my rub rack.
