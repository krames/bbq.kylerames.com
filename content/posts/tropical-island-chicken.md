Lately, I have fallen into a trap of reaching for the same cookbooks and making the same things over and over. So to break the mold, I decided pick a recipe out of something new, [Taste of Home - The Ultimate Guide to Grilling](http://www.shoptasteofhome.com/grilling/guidetogrilling.html) I flipped through it a several times and always seemed to stop at tropical island chicken. I decided that was the one and my wife went off to HEB.

She came back with a whole HEB natural fryer chicken for 5 bucks! Up to this point, My only experience with whole chickens has been [spatchcocking](http://www.nakedwhiz.com/spatch.htm). This recipe required me to go a bit further and quarter the chicken. Luckily, there are a lot of excellent [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=quarter+chicken) videos to show you the way. All the videos demonstrated breaking down a chicken using a chef's knife, but I ended up throwing  a pair of poultry shears into the mix. (It seemed to make it a LOT easier).

Here is the recipe:

###### Ingredients
1/4 cup reduced-sodium soy sauce
1/3 cup canola oil
1/4 cup water
2 tbsp dried minced onion
2 tbsp sesame seeds
1 tbsp sugar
4 garlic cloves, minced
1 tsp ground ginger
3/4 tsp salt
1/8 tsp cayenne pepper

###### Directions

1. Combine ingredients put in bag along with chicken quarters. Marinate for 8 hours to overnight.
2. Indirectly grill chicken over indirect medium heat for 45-60 minutes.

I ended up cooking these indirect on my egg for 45 minutes @ 400. I pulled the breasts when they hit 160 and kept the thighs on until they hit 178-180. The wings came off when they looked ready. I then did a final sear on my Weber Genesis for a minute or so to get the skin nice and crisp. 

We had these with some [Raging River](http://www.amazon.com/Dizzy-Pig-Raging-River-Spice/dp/B005PI0RJG/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1430597710&sr=8-1) coated green beans and a loaf of french bread.

The chicken came out super juicy and it was easily some of the best chicken I have ever had. Next time, I think I might add a little more cayenne pepper to the marinade.
