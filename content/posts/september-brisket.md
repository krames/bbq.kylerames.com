One of Jen's favorite foods is brisket (and let be honest...isn't it one of the everyone's favorite foods?). So for her birthday, I decided it was time to fire up my egg.

I went to Costco, and I found a nice looking 14.84lb Prime Brisket.

The night before dinner, I trimmed up the brisket and rubbed it down with kosher salt and coarse ground black pepper. I also injected it with some low sodium beef broth. It then went into the refrigerator to wait for the next day.

The next morning I started the egg around 8 am and let it warm up to 250째F for about an hour. In the meantime, I took the brisket out of the fridge around 8:30 to take the chill off.  The brisket went on at 9:12 am.

The Brisket hit 160째F around 12 pm so I pulled it out and wrapped it along with some more low sodium beef broth.

Towards 3 pm it started to rain, so I had to run out and cover up my pit controller.

At 4:11 pm, it looked like we were getting close, so I ran out with my thermapen and took a couple of measurements. It was registering 210째F at one end and 200째F at the other. (I had lost track of which end was the point and which end was the flat.) I decided to pull it shortly after that because I was worried about part of it overcooking.

I wrapped it up in another layer of aluminum foil and double wrapped it in towels like usual. We pulled it out of the oven and unwrapped it around 5:42 pm and ate shortly after that.

Here what the final product looked like:

I was very happy with the results, but I don't think it was quite as good as briskets past. It could be the meat. Or it could be that this brisket was a little too big for the egg and I had to drape it over an inverted roasting rack for the first part of the cook. I also think that the end of the flat extended past the heat shield of the place setter. I might look into trimming it down or rotating the brisket earlier in the cook. I could also try just to separate the flat and point when one end has already finished.

For my next brisket, I want to skip the aluminum foil during the cook which means an overnight cook! It should be easy with a pit controller, right?
